# Consolidated View Feature Test Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the test cases for the consolidated view feature implementation.

## Features Implemented

### 1. View Toggle Switch
- **Location**: Added to session section between stats and cards list
- **Functionality**: Toggles between default list view and consolidated grid view
- **Default State**: Unchecked (normal view)

### 2. Card Size Slider
- **Visibility**: Only shown when consolidated view is enabled
- **Range**: 80px to 200px in 10px increments
- **Default**: 120px
- **Updates**: Real-time resize of cards in consolidated view

### 3. Consolidated Grid View
- **Layout**: CSS Grid with responsive columns
- **Card Content**: 
  - Card image (same loading logic as normal view)
  - Card name (truncated with ellipsis if too long)
  - Rarity display
  - Both TCG prices (Low and Market)
  - Quantity badge (if quantity > 1)

### 4. Hover Popups
- **Trigger**: Mouse enter on consolidated cards
- **Content**: 
  - Set Code
  - Set Name  
  - Card Number
  - Art Variant
  - Last Update
  - Source URL (clickable if available)
- **Behavior**: Auto-positioned to stay within viewport

## Test Cases

### Manual Testing (via browser)
1. Open application and navigate to Pack Ripper tab
2. Verify view controls are present but card size slider is hidden
3. Start a session and add some cards
4. Toggle consolidated view - verify:
   - Card size slider appears
   - Cards switch to grid layout
   - All card data is preserved
5. Adjust card size slider - verify cards resize in real time
6. Hover over cards in consolidated view - verify popup appears with correct data
7. Move mouse away - verify popup disappears
8. Toggle back to normal view - verify cards return to list format

### Code Quality Tests
- [x] JavaScript syntax validation passed
- [x] CSS loads without errors  
- [x] Module imports work correctly
- [x] No console errors during initialization

### Integration Tests
- [x] New DOM elements are properly referenced
- [x] Event listeners are correctly attached
- [x] View state is managed properly
- [x] Existing session functionality is preserved

## Key Implementation Details

### CSS Classes Added
- `.view-controls` - Container for toggle and slider
- `.toggle-switch` - Toggle switch styling  
- `.session-cards.consolidated` - Grid layout for consolidated view
- `.session-card.consolidated` - Individual card styling in grid
- `.card-popup` - Hover popup styling

### JavaScript Methods Added
- `handleViewToggle()` - Manages view switching
- `handleCardSizeChange()` - Updates card size
- `updateSessionViewMode()` - Applies CSS classes
- `createConsolidatedCardElement()` - Creates grid cards
- `showCardPopup()` / `hideCardPopup()` - Manages hover popups

### State Variables Added
- `isConsolidatedView` - Current view mode
- `cardSize` - Current card size setting  
- `currentPopup` - Reference to active popup

## Browser Compatibility
- Uses CSS Grid (supported in all modern browsers)
- Uses CSS Custom Properties (--card-size variable)
- Uses modern JavaScript (ES6+ features)
- Responsive design maintained

## Accessibility Considerations
- Toggle switch includes proper labels
- Slider includes value display
- Popups positioned to stay within viewport
- All interactive elements maintain focus states
- No changes to existing keyboard navigation

## Performance Considerations
- Card images use existing loading logic
- Popups are created/destroyed on demand
- CSS transitions are hardware accelerated
- Grid layout uses efficient CSS properties
